# Welcome!
Hello and welcome to my creative GitHub repository! I have added some examples of my best pieces of creative work, I hope you like them :)

Starting with my portfolio from a second year module in my Biology BSc undergrad called Biological Photographing and Imaging (BP&I for short). This is where I started to learn about my camera settings and how to capture the world around me. Flick through the directory above for all the pages.

Leading on from this is my portfolio for the third year sequel to the second year module - Biological Photographing and Imaging 2 (BP&I2 for short). In this portfolio I built on the skills learnt from the second year module and wrote two articles, my favourite being the one on my housemate Katie who was a nursing student at the time.

Bee-cause you liked the first two, here is a poster I made for a Social Insetcs Year 3 module about a North American bee war.
